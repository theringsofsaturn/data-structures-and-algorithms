// LeetCode 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

// Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

// According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

function lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q) {
  if (!root) return null;
  if (root === p || root === q) return root;
  const left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
  const right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
  if (left && right) return root;
  return left ? left : right;
}
