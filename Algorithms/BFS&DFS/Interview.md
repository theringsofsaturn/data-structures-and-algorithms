# Which one would you use, BFS or DFS? 
*check file BFS&DFS.js for information

# If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:

BFS

# If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare,

BFS (DFS will take long time. )

# If the tree is very wide:

DFS (BFS will need too much memory)

# If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree

DFS

# Determining whether a path exists between two nodes

DFS

# Finding the shortest path

BFS
